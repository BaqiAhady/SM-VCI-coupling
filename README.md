# Overview:
This repository contains the R and GEE scripts used to analyze soil moisture–vegetation coupling
and to identify soil moisture thresholds for agricultural drought in the paper titled "Identifying soil moisture thresholds for agricultural drought sensitivity through coupling modeled and satellite data in a humid temperate catchment"

## Data sources
- Soil moisture data: German Weather Service (DWD), Climate Data Center
- MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1): NASA Earthdata, Google Earth Engine (GEE)
Note: The raw data are publicly available from the above sources and are not redistributed here.

## Usage
1. Download soil moisture data from DWD
2. Access MODIS NDVI data (e.g., via Google Earth Engine)
3. Run scripts in the order listed in `run_order.txt`

## Requirements
- R (≥ 4.2)
- Packages listed in `requirements.R`
